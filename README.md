## ParticleCollision
ParticleCollision is a particle physics simulation that uses Unity and compute shaders to simulate particle interactions. The simulation is entirely GPU-based, meaning that it is computationally efficient and can handle large numbers of particles without a significant performance hit. The project is entirely code-generated, and it does not require any assets or images to run.

## Usage
The ParticleCollision project is simple to use. All you need to do is to open the Unity project and run the scene. The scene contains a simple particle system that you can interact with by clicking on the screen. The particles will collide with each other, and you can observe the results of these collisions in real-time.

## Unity version
The ParticleCollision project was made on the following version: Unity 2021.3.18f1

## Installation
To install the ParticleCollision project, follow these steps:

- Download the unityPackage and drag it to the Unity project you want to.

or 

- Clone the repository to your local machine, open the project in Unity and run the main scene.

## Future Development
The ParticleCollision project is not finished yet, some features I plan on developing:

- Fixing spatial partitioning.
- Adding support for device rotation in mobile.
- Adding static objects for the particle to collide.

## Contributing
Contributions to the ParticleCollision project are welcome. If you have an idea for how to improve the simulation or would like to add a new feature, feel free to submit a pull request.
